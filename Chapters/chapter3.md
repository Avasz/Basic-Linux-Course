#Chapter 3 - Graphical Interface

This chapter will help you to:  
* Manage graphical interface sessions.  
* Perform basic operations using the graphical interface.
* Change graphical desktop to suit your needs.

###3.1 Introduction and basic session managements
Linux Operating System can be used in either Command Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI). We need to remember the commands and their arguements/parameters to use Linux in CLI mode. GUI mode provides with quick, easy and user friendly way of using the system. We can interact with the system using mouse and keyboard, clicking windows, buttons etc. CLI is more efficient, quick and increases productivity in certain tasks whereas GUI is easier to navigate and work on day to day tasks such as web browsing, watching movie etc.  

Linux operating systems come with various Desktop Environments. Desktop Environment comes with varieties of components to provide commong graphical user interface elements such as icons, toolbars, wallpapers, windows etc. Generally, each desktop environment in Linux comes with their own set of applications and utilities. They are also generally developed using different languages and frameworks. Also, each of them has their own special characteristics, for eg: XFCE, LXDE proves to be lightweight, fast and more suitable for older hardwares or hardwares with less resources, but GNOME, KDE etc. are more resource hungry than XFCE & LXDE but comes with more features and functions as well as looks really better than them. Users are free to install set of applications from one Desktop Environment on another provided the dependencies are fulfilled.  

In Linux system, a functional X server installation is required for any Desktop Environment, or better say any Graphical User Interface to show up. It starts at the end of the boot process. It is responsible for starting the graphics system, loggin in ghe user to Desktop Environment etc.  

Different Desktop Environments have different Display Managers (DMs). The default display manager for GNOME is called gdm, similarly KDM is for KDE. Also their are Display Managers like lightdm which can be used with any Desktop Environment easily.

**Practical:**  *(Session Managements)*  
1. Loggin in and Logging out of the system. *(Logging out of your current desktop environment kills all processes in your current X session, always save before logging out.)*  
2. Locking screen  
3. Switching users  
4. Shutting Down & Restarting  
5. Suspending Session
