#Libresoft IT Solutions, Basic Linux Course

This repository contains the course contents that will be taught in Libresoft IT Solutions as part of Basic Linux Course package.
For now this has been heavily inspired from ** LinuxFoundationX: LFS101x.2 Introduction to Linux ** online course and other documentations such as TLDP and ubuntu wiki, etc.  
Will work on updating the contents in timely manner so that it doesn't look like cheap derivative of LFS's course. :D
