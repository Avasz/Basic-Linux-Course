<h3 id="history">1. History</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Linux is a free open source computer operating system.</li>
<li>Developed initially for x86 architecture but now ported to lots of other architectures like amd64, arm, arm64 etc.</li>
<li>Linus Torvalds, in 1991, started a project of writing his own kernel for operating system. This came to be known as Linux kernel.</li>
<li>Linux was licensed using GPL (GNU Public License) in 1992.</li>
<li>It helped in combining the kernel developed by Linus with other components from GNU project.</li>
<li>Hence in mid 90's developers created a complete operating system called Linux Distribution.</li>
<li>Major companies like IBM and Oracle announced support for Linux.</li>
<li>Today after 20+ years we can see Linux being used widely in almost every areas ranging from more than half of the servers in the world to SmartPhones as Android.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="philosophy">2. Philosophy</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Linux operating system is a Free and Open Source version of Unix, hence it borrows heavily from Unix operating system.</li>
<li>Linux is a fully multitasking &amp; multiuser operating system.</li>
<li>It has build in networking and service processes.</li>
<li>Whenever possible, linux makes all the components available via file or objects that look like files. eg. Processes, devices etc are all represented by files.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="community">3. Community</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Linux Community is a community of large number of users form all over the world.</li>

</ol>
<h3 id="linux-distributions">5. Linux Distributions</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Linux is actually a kernel.</li>
<li>Linux kernel is core of a Linux Based Computer Operating Systems.</li>
<li>A complete Operating System consists of Kernel and a number of other components like softwares, user management tools, networking tools etc.</li>
<li>There are lots of Linux based operating systems developed with the main Linux kernel at its core but with different components. They may be different in terms of performance, in terms of looks, in terms of softwares, in terms of philosophy etc. These different Operating systems based on Linux Kernels are known as Linux Distributions or Linux Distros in short.</li>
<li>Some examples of Linux Distros are: Ubuntu, Fedora, Kali, Debian, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="summary">6. Summary</h3>
